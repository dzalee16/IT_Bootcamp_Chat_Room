# IT_Bootcamp_Chat_Room
This is my final project at the course of Web Development (JavaScript) in the IT Bootcamp. The course were for the last 10 weeks, and I learn a lot from it. 
In our last project, which is (Chat Room), I use OOP, asnyc function, callback methods, and make project with VanillaJS, HTML5 and CSS3 from strach.
Thanks to all from IT Bootcamp school, especially to my profesors J and S. It's been a pleasure to be part of the team and to learn new things every day.
